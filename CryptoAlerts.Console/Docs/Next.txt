Add analysis to the Message. 
(Where else is that Coin is listed, what is the price, predicted gain, buy and sell price)

Add API to post messages on Twitter. Create a special Crypto alerts twitter 
(Crypto alerts, coin alerts, buy signals, analysis?) - Maybe worth doing to manipulate the market in my favor. But this will need to be done later after I have more alerts that are worth sharing (also think which alerts to share that can help me).

Add alert for Coinfloor, Coin Base and proper one for CoinExchange - I need to figure out where this info comes from.

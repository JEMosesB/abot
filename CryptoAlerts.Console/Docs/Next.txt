Prepare for NIO sell - wait 1 more day and sell Nio at 08. Dont believe it will go much higher.
Open limits on more exchanges - In progress need to check in a few days.
Plan exchange movements for speed - 1st thing I need to do is gather all my money back in one place first. Hello Binance!

Add analysis to the Message. 
(Where else is that Coin is listed, what is the price, predicted gain, buy and sell price)

Add API to post messages on Twitter. Create a special Crypto alerts twitter 
(Crypto alerts, coin alerts, buy signals, analysis?) - Maybe worth doing to manipulate the market in my favor. But this will need to be done later after I have more alerts that are worth sharing (also think which alerts to share that can help me).

Add alert for Coinfloor, Coin Base and proper one for CoinExchange - I need to figure out where this info comes from.

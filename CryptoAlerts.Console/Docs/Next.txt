Analise buy signal more thoroughly (CoinMarketCap!!!)

Add AWS hosting.

Priority 0:
Gate tio
Keep an eye on NIO - CMC

Analyse past alerts
Remember! From now on only buy for short term!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a couple hours - to 1 day max!!!!! Just until initial spike stops!!!!! Dont hold hoping it will go higher!!!!! Sell when you can!!!!
You lost so much time and or money because you dont sell when you can!!! Moon, PRE, PACCoin, NIO, dfs!!!

Always analyse next investment in terms of speed of return! -> How much time will transfers take, how long will it take to cash out, is it a quick pump and dump or longer term hold investment? Are the markets and wallets all work correctly? Is there a withdrawal limit?

Add analysis to the Message. 
(Where else is that Coin is listed, what is the price, predicted gain, buy and sell price)

Add API to post messages on Twitter. Create a special Crypto alerts twitter 
(Crypto alerts, coin alerts, buy signals, analysis?) - Maybe worth doing to manipulate the market in my favor. But this will need to be done later after I have more alerts that are worth sharing (also think which alerts to share that can help me).

Add alert for Coinfloor, Coin Base and proper one for CoinExchange - I need to figure out where this info comes from.

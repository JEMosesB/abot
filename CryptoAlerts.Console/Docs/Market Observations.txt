BitHTC - Large exchange, announcements are worthless - best to stay away though as many people have bad experiences and it has terrible reviews. Could be due to the size though. Although I got error even trying to register. Seems useless.
Okex - medium large exchange (174), however its announcements are useless, not worth to register as its chinese.


CoinMarketCapApi signal:
OKEx - when only Okex, always goes down.
HitBtc - always goes up.
Tidex - TRASH!!!!
Kucoin - SelfKEy, started on Kucoin, then on CMC, went up after a fall.
Kucoin - Ins - didnt go up
Bottos was on 3 markets already (Gate, Bibox, BigONE) - small up, then down

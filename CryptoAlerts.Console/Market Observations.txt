BitHTC - Large exchange, announcements are worthless - best to stay away though as many people have bad experiences and it has terrible reviews. Could be due to the size though. Although I got error even trying to register. Seems useless.
Okex - medium large exchange (174), however its announcements are useless, not worth to register as its chinese.
